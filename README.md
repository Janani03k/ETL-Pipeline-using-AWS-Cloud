## Project Aim

Our goal was to create an efficient ETL pipeline, capable of handling large-scale data migrations and processing, with a focus on visualization and error reporting.

## Why This Problem Statement

We found ETL Cloud Data Warehousing to be a new and exciting challenge, offering an opportunity to learn from scratch and explore a less-trodden path in data engineering.

## Initial Solution

Our initial approach involved extracting data from SQL Server, loading it into Postgres, and automating the pipeline using Airflow, with a focus on incremental data loading and visualization using Alteryx.

## Our Cloud-Based Solution

We transitioned to a cloud-based solution to simplify data processing, handle large data volumes, and enable the combination of data from multiple sources. This approach facilitated easier visualization, debugging, and data analysis.

## Tools Used

- **DBeaver**: For database management.
- **Redshift Data Pipeline**: For large-scale data storage and analysis.
- **Glue**: To extract data and incorporate it into data lakes and warehouses.
- **CloudWatch**: For application and resource monitoring.
- **QuickSight**: For delivering insights and data visualization.

## Technical Explanation

Our solution involved setting up a Redshift cluster, creating S3 buckets, configuring DataNodes, and creating EC2 instances. We also implemented incremental data pipelines and AWS Glue Jobs.

## Front-End Development

The front end was developed using ReactJS and deployed on Netlify, with domain configurations done on the AWS page.

## Optimization Techniques

We employed various optimization techniques like compound sort keys, Redshift DIST keys, and vacuuming to enhance the efficiency of our pipeline.

## Viability

Our pipeline showed significant improvements in metrics like time in queue, run time, and data scanned, demonstrating its viability.

## Market Realism

Our solution is ideal for large-scale businesses working with huge data volumes, offering centralized location benefits, business intelligence capabilities, and cloud-based safety and optimization.

## Future Plans

We aim to further develop and enhance our ETL pipeline, ensuring it remains cutting-edge and market-relevant.
